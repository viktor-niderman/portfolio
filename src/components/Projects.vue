        On this project, I created a site based on the "Landrick" template,

        with other developers, and some we developed from scratch.
        Among other things, a CRM system based on "Orchid" was developed from scratch
        to manage subscriptions to these extensions,
        and Stripe was also integrated for payment.`,
